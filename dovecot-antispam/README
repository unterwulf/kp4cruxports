POST-INSTALL

To activate this plugin add the following lines into your dovecot.conf.
Note, this port makes use of the mail sending backend, so the spam and
notspam aliases should be set up in exim.conf to retrain spam and ham
respectively.

protocol imap {
    mail_plugins = antispam
}

plugin {
    antispam_signature = X-DSPAM-Signature
    antispam_signature_missing = error

    antispam_trash = Trash
    # antispam_spam_pattern = SPAM
    # antispam_spam_pattern_ignorecase = SPAM

    antispam_mail_tmpdir = /tmp
    antispam_mail_sendmail = /usr/sbin/exim
    antispam_mail_sendmail_args = -f;%u;-- # % expansion done by dovecot
    antispam_mail_spam = spam
    antispam_mail_notspam = notspam
}
